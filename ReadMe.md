## Premise 
Tortuga is an alternative course catalog that has an enhanced UI and feature-rich compabilities compared to [Testudo](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc), University of Maryland's official schedule of classes. Tortuga provides faster lookups including an all-in-one interface as well as a notification systems where students can track and get notified of any class openings. 

## Spring 2025 Cycle Statistics (March 1st 2025 - May 15th 2025) 

### `29,933` Site Views
### `3,176` total unique users 
### `512` course availability notifications sent
### `131` total registered users 

## Technologies 

### Frontend Development 
I used `Nuxt.js` and `TailwindCSS`, and also used `FontAwesome Icons` throughout the app to contribute to a clean user experience. 

### Backend Development 
I used `TypeScript` to write my backend scripts and `MongoDB` to store all user data and notification caches. The web scraper (in a different repository) that gathers data from [Testudo](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc) is built with `Python`, `FastAPI`, & `BeautifulSoup`.
