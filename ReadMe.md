## Technologies 

### Frontend Development 
I used `Nuxt.js` and `TailwindCSS`, and also used `FontAwesome Icons` throughout the app to contribute to a clean user experience. 

### Backend Development 
I used `TypeScript` to write my backend scripts and `MongoDB` to store all user data and notification caches. The web scraper (in a different repository) that gathers data from [Testudo](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc) is built with `Python`, `FastAPI`, & `BeautifulSoup`.
